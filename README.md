# CS50 AI in Python Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed by Sean Grady for the Harvard CS50 Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Course Description

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python projects.

## Project List

1. [Project 0: Search]
2. [Project 1: Knowledge]
3. [Project 2: Uncertainty]
4. [Project 3: Optimization]
5. [Project 4: Learning]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/scgrady13/CS50-AI-In-Python-.git

2. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run any project using the command:

python project[x]/[filename].py

## Usage

Each project has its own directory containing a README file with specific instructions on how to run the project and what it does.

## Credits

The projects and specifications were created by Harvard University's CS50 team for the CS50 AI with Python course. Any additional code was written by Sean Grady.
